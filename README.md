The How to Platformer project is a project which started with Brackeys great tutorial on the matter ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR42oVBU6K2DIL6Y22Ry9J1c ) but got a little deviation, since I wanted to keep things really simple for my friends who are beginners in Unity. 

Most scripts are commented (in French though) and people will be able to poke around the different features to make their own level design, change the graphic assets, etc.
